## Reporting a Vulnerability

The best place to submit a vulnerability is by emailing me here: [mitchelld@redsevenstudios.com](mailto:mitchelld@redsevenstudios.com). However, if it isn't a HUGE vulnerability then you can report it on the [Double D Development Forum](https://doubleddevelopment.tk/c/bug-reports/ezcar-bug-reports/35).
